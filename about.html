        <p>This is the little cache of html on the internet dedicated to me, Michael Carpenter (aka oldmanmike on the internet), and my drive to master my craft as a programmer. I currently work in the IT department of Earlham College where I recently finished my degree, but in my free time I write a lot of Haskell (among many other languages) and working on <a href="https://github.com/oldmanmike/opensandbox">OpenSandbox</a> and its satellite projects. Within the domain of software, my main areas pertain mainly to exploring topics of game development, distributed &amp; parallel computing, and machine learning through the lens of a purely functional programming paradigm. My current open source focus is to fully scout the capabilities and limitations of Haskell and its ability to be a useful programming language for real work. I have yet to hit a wall. The purpose of this blog is to document the interesting, showcase the unappreciated, and question the assumed. It’s to explain that which I cannot do justice with ad-hoc words on the spot and to off-load that which has been thrashing around in my mental cache and needs a concrete home in markdown. Hopefully you find something here of value.</p>
<p>Most of my work can be found on <a href="https://github.com/oldmanmike">Github</a>. If you want to contact me, send me an email at <a href="mcarpenter.dev@gmail.com" class="uri">mcarpenter.dev@gmail.com</a>. I’m also on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/3961879/oldmanmike">stackoverflow</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jatosloth">twitter</a>.</p>
